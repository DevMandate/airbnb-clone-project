# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a simplified clone of the AirBnB platform, built as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. It aims to replicate the core features of AirBnB such as listing properties, user management, and bookings.

## Project Goals
- Understand the fundamentals of back-end and front-end integration.
- Implement object-oriented programming with Python.
- Build and test a full-stack web application.
- Learn how to use version control with Git and GitHub in a team setting.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Backend:** Flask (or console-based for initial phase)
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS (basic for now)
- **Database:** MySQL (or file storage initially)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Ensure intuitive navigation for both property seekers and hosts.
- Keep interfaces clean and clutter-free to improve user experience.
- Make the platform responsive and mobile-friendly.
- Use consistent styling and layout across all pages.
- Ensure fast page loads and clear feedback on actions like booking or searching.

### Key Features to Implement
- Property search with filters (location, price, type).
- Visual property cards with preview images and key info.
- Detailed property view with booking form.
- Secure and simplified checkout process.
- User login/signup and dashboard view (host/guest).
- Favorites or Wishlist for saved properties.

### Primary Pages Overview

| Page                   | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays all available properties in grid or list format. Includes search bar, filters, and pagination. Each card shows image, title, location, price, and quick actions. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows full details of a selected property: image gallery, full description, amenities, host info, reviews, and booking calendar. |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | Booking form where users input date range, guest info, and confirm payment. Clean and secure interface with price breakdown and booking confirmation. |

### Importance of a User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly design in a booking system is crucial for:
- Reducing user friction during the booking process.
- Building trust by presenting clean, professional layouts.
- Increasing conversions by making it easy to search, view, and book properties.
- Enhancing accessibility for users of all backgrounds and devices.
